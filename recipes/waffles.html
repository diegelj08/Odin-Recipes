    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a great, basic, easy waffle. My waffle iron sat unused for--literally--10 years. Wanted to try something new this morning with
     basic ingredients that I knew I had in the kitchen. The first waffle didn't turn out because I didn't use enough batter--my waffle iron needed about
     2/3 cup each--but after that they were perfect. For those new to waffle-making, here is a good tip I have used to know when they are done
     without having to open the iron constantly to look (which can ruin the waffle if it is still soft)... It's done when the waffle quits ejecting plumes
     of steam around the edges of the iron. (It's also usually done when it quits sticking to the iron.) Will definitely make these again -- probably tomorrow!</p>
     <h4>Ingredients</h4>
     <ul>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 ¾ cups milk</li>
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
     </ul>
     <h4>Steps</h4>
     <ol>
         <li>Preheat waffle iron. Beat eggs in large bowl with hand beater until fluffy. Beat in flour, milk, vegetable oil, sugar,
             baking powder, salt and vanilla, just until smooth.</li>
         <li>Spray preheated waffle iron with non-stick cooking spray. Pour mix onto hot waffle iron. Cook until golden brown. Serve hot.</li>
     </ol>
