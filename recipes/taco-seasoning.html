    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This recipe was a life-saver!! After already mixing ingrediants for "seven layer taco dip," I realized that I was out of taco seasoning.
     Frantic, I ran to the computer and found this! YEAH!! I mixed it in with some cream cheese and sour cream to taste it first and it was great.
     Worked even better in the dip!! If I'd had known how easy this was, I would have been making my own taco seasoning for a while now!!
     The only thing I changed was reduced the chili powder to 1/2 TBSP.Very good and will make again!! Thanks Bill for posting this!</p>
